# Workers Pose Strain Warning System

The **Workers Pose Strain Warning System** leverages advanced computer vision and deep learning techniques to monitor workers' posture and personal protective equipment (PPE) compliance in real-time. The system uses two models: one for detecting the presence of PPE (like hardhats and safety vests) and another for assessing ergonomic posture based on workers' poses.

## Importance of the System

The importance of this system lies in its ability to identify both safety violations (e.g., missing hardhats or safety vests) and ergonomic issues that could lead to physical strain or injury. For example, if a worker maintains an incorrect posture for an extended period, such as a hunched back or head low, the system sends a warning to prevent long-term injuries like musculoskeletal disorders. Similarly, if a worker is not wearing the required PPE, the system immediately detects the violation and triggers an alert.

This system is crucial in workplaces where manual labor or physical activity is common, such as construction sites or factories, ensuring the safety and well-being of workers.
